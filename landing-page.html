                    <p class="bio">My name is Wilson, and I'm a recent computer science graduate and part-time game developer. I've been enthused with playing and making games from a young age, and I like solving unique problems. I also like creating art and working alongside a team, so founding Mad Lad Games was like moving into a new home. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I've enjoyed making them.</p>
